# Image-Analysis
Image analysis using CNN.

We make use of keras and tensorflow to implement a convolution neural network which helps us differentiate between the picture of a cat and the picture of the dog.

## Documentation

[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide), keras runs on top of tensorflow

[Keras](https://keras.io/) library used for building the neural network

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/) library 

# Library Installation

* pip install tensorflow
* pip install Keras
* pip install numpy
